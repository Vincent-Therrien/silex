Wildfire Prediction Software
----------------------------

This repository presents wildfire modelling technologies.


Empirical Models
++++++++++++++++

**Empirical** wildfire modelling tools are based on **observations**.
Researchers analyze how wildfires behave and write programs that approximate
these fires to forecast their evolution.

Examples of empirical wildfire modelling tools:

- `BehavePlus <https://research.fs.usda.gov/firelab/products/dataandtools/behaveplus>`__
- `FlamMap <https://research.fs.usda.gov/firelab/products/dataandtools/flammap>`__
- `FARSITE (now part of FlamMap) <https://research.fs.usda.gov/firelab/products/dataandtools/farsite>`__

These tools rely on multiple types of data and combine several models to
simulate the complexity of wildfires appropriately. The file
`forecast.ipynb`__ presents databases and models used to forecast wildfires
and explains how to run FARSITE simulations on your own system. You'll need
`Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/download>`__ to run the notebook.


Chaos Visualization
+++++++++++++++++++

Wildfires and meteorological phenomena are highly sensitive to small effects,
like small differences in temperature, which can dramatically change how they
evolve. This sensitivity is called *chaos*. To visualize this effect, refer to
the file `chaos/readme.rst`__.
